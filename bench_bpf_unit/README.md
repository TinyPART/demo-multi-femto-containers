# Bench BPF unit test example

This benchmark application benchmarks a number of representative instructions on
different BPF interpreters for RIOT. The output contains the time it takes for
each instruction to run. The benchmark application can be compiled and executed
on any RIOT supported board.

The femto-container application is generated and executed in the `main()` function
of this example and used to benchmark the loaded application.

Toggling the interpreter is done via the `FEMTO` variable in the
Makefile.

## Compiling and Running the example

### Running directly on Linux

Compiling this example can be done via

```Console
koen@zometeen examples/bench_bpf_unit $ make all
Building application "tests_bench_bpf_unit" for "native" with MCU "native".

rm -Rf RIOT/build/pkg/femto-container
mkdir -p $(dirname RIOT/build/pkg/femto-container)
cp -a RIOT/../femto-containers RIOT/build/pkg/femto-container
touch RIOT/build/pkg/femto-container/.prepared
"make" -C RIOT/pkg/femto-container/

```

In this case the example is compiled for RIOT native, so that it can be run
directly as application on a Linux installation. Running the example can be done
with:

```Console
koen@zometeen examples/bench_bpf_unit $ make term
examples/bench_bpf_unit/bin/native/tests_bench_bpf_unit.elf /dev/ttyACM0
RIOT native interrupts/signals initialized.
RIOT native board initialized.
RIOT native hardware initialization complete.

As the instance is running on a unconstrained Linux computer the performance
benchmarks will be multiple times faster than on an embedded target.

### Running on a target board

The `BOARD` variable can be supplied with the `make` command to adjust the
target of the compilation.
To compile for an embedded target supported by RIOT, for example the
[nRF52840 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-DK),
the following can be run:

```
koen@zometeen ~/dev/middleware2022-femtocontainers/examples/bench_bpf_unit $ make all flash BOARD=nrf52840dk

This compiles and flashes the firmware on the connected board. Note that this
requires a toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc) and flashing tooling to be installed.
See the [RIOT help for flashing](https://api.riot-os.org/flashing.html)
around this for more information and help with different supported boards.

When the board is flashed, the output from the test can be viewed via the serial
connection via:

Here there is a notable performance overhead per instruction. The output is a
CSV-derived format with the following columns:

* `idx`: test index
* `test`: eBPF instruction tested
* `duration`: Full duration in milliseconds of this test case.
* `code`: Return code of the instruction, was it successful?
* `usperinst`: Microseconds per individual instruction.
* `instrpersec`: Number of instructions of this type that can be executed per
  second.

Depending on the board used and the performance of the microcontroller, these
numbers may vary.
